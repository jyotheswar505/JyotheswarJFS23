        <hr>

         <p>After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Independence_Act_1947">Indian Independence</a> Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its army to 
            patrol the country's border. In 1952 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Bullet">Royal Enfield Bullet</a> was chosen as the most suitable bike for the job. 
            In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras 
            Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras
            (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components.[7] By 1962,
            all the components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield 
            still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc and 500 cc models, along with several different models for
            different market segments.</p>
